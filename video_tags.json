It's great to be here.","Our pleasure. Ok, our goal for today is to help our audience become better leaders","by simultaneously excelling in four areas of their life, work, home, community, and self.","Right.","So let's begin by allowing me to play devil's advocate.","We're talking about work here. Why do I care about the other three areas?","Why care about your family, society, and your private self—your mind and body and spirit—when your primary focus is work?","Well, the most important reason is that these other parts of your life affect your work.","So how things are going at work, or in your private sphere of mind, body and spirit","and your sense of contribution to society or to your friendship networks, your social groups—all that affects your performance at work.","And one of the things that we've found is that the more you can bring the whole person in,","the more energy, the more productivity, the more commitment, loyalty and focus you have at work.","So it makes business sense to account for the whole person's interests and passions.","Is what we're talking about here work-life balance? Or is there something more to it than that?","A lot of people talk about work-life balance—","many more people today than when I first started addressing this issue 20 years ago when my first son was born.","And it's become a very present issue in many different sectors of our society and abroad. And there's a lot of important reasons for that.","But balance is the wrong metaphor.","Balance is the wrong metaphor because it implies trade-offs.","It implies that you've got to give up one part of your life to have success in another part.","And what I want to encourage people to do is to see the possibility of what I call \"four-way wins,\"","which requires that you use leadership to better integrate the different parts of your life, all four—work, home, community and self;","and to generate the support that you need from the key people around you for making change,","creating meaningful, sustainable change in how, where, and when you get things done","so that it's better for you and better for the different people in the different parts of your life.","And what I find is that when you do that, when you take an approach that is not about trading off or balancing","but rather integrating in an intelligent way that fits your life, your world, that actually works.","So help me out here. I'm like a lot of members of our audience, so I'm sure I was brought up with a mentality that life is about trade-offs,","that you do have to be willing to sacrifice in one area to excel in another.","So let's get specific here. Help us understand how to take that leap to this new mentality.","It starts with being real, which means understanding what really matters to you.","And so there's a couple of really fun and interesting ways of doing that:","looking at your core values, looking at your future. What's the legacy you want to leave for the world 20 years hence?","What are the most important parts of your life today in terms of work, home, community and self?","So you take the \"four-way view\" and see, well, which of these parts are really most important to me?","And where do I focus my time and attention? And how are things going in each of the different domains?","So all that is part of being real, what really matters.","The second piece, be whole, is about understanding the needs and interests—","what I call the performance expectations—of the key stakeholders, the most important people in your life, in the different parts of your life.","See, you think about and write about who the most important people are and what your mutual expectations are,","at work, at home, in the community, and for yourself in terms of your own mental health, physical health,","and a spiritual growth and development, and leisure.","And see, you have a new perspective on \"Where now can I create sustainable change?\"","\"Where now can I experiment with how to bring the different parts together in a way that produces a four-way win?\"","So that's the third part: be innovative.","Act with creativity by experimenting with how you do things.","And so the fun part is experimenting.","So what kinds of experiments do people do?","Well, they range from changing the where and when of getting things done—","what I call time-shifting or replacing—working at home a day a week for example;","or in a more micro scale, focusing and concentrating experiments","where you shut off your Blackberry from the hours of 6 to 10 pm a couple of nights a week,","and see what benefits that brings for the different domains of your life, the different areas;","or there's the example that I write about in the article:","a man who was new to his community and was working in a financial services company","wanted to become a high potential for executive promotion in his company,","and also wanted to join a community board that would involve his fiancee who is very interested in community service activities,","and would also connect him more closer with his sister who is a special education teacher.","So his experiment was to join this community board and to extend his network in a professional context in the community.","Of course the bank saw that as it was good for them. And it was also good for his family as well as for himself and his community.","So those are some examples.","Great, so we've got something of an arc here that begins with introspection, reflection, discussion with others,","finding that gap between who you are, who you want to be, and experimentation.","Right, so when I talk to people months and years down the road about what they take away from this process,","it's less about the impact of a particular experiment than it is on their capacity to lead change in all the different parts of their life.","And that's really a primary goal of this approach.","Stewart Friedman, thanks very much.","Thank you.","To learn about how to put Stew's ideas into practice, you can visit his website

To begin, let me tell you one of the great rules of economics:","If you are rich, you have to be an idiot not to stay rich, and if you are poor, you have to be really smart to get rich.","This is true for individuals, but it's also true for countries.","Fancypants countries with fancypants currencies have all kinds of advantages over developing countries","including that we are able to borrow money cheaply.","In fact, because fancypants countries can borrow money so cheaply,","it actually often makes sense to run a deficit.","And the reason for this is that in the long term, our economy can grow faster than the cheap,","cheap debt we're acquiring to pay for our economy to grow.","So that is not inherently bad for nations.","The famous example for this is that in 1945 the United States had a debt that was more than one hundred percent of its GDP,","and our deficit was more than twenty percent of our GDP,","and that level of debt immediately preceded the largest expansion of our economy in history,","also the largest expansion of our waistlines in history.","Yes, that's funny, we did get fat.","So debt is not bad!","But debt that you can't repay is very bad.","The trick of fancypants countries being able to borrow money cheaply","has always been that the market assumes that fancypants countries are basically guaranteed to pay you back.","And when I said the market assumes,","I mean the market assumed until two months ago","when they realized that Greece,","a fancypants country with a fancypants currency,","maybe can't pay back its debts.","What's interesting is that Greece is probably technically in a better economic position than America was back in 1945.","But for a variety of reasons, some of the very legitimate,","the markets has cited that Greece won't be able to pay back its debt,","which in turn has led to new debt being much more expensive,","which has in turn made it completely impossible for Greece to ever pay its debt.","You see! Hank, there's a circle, and it's vicious.","That's where they got the term.","This raises the possibilities that fancypants countries","with fancypants currencies might not pay back the money we loan them,","which will probably raise interest rates for a lot of fancypants countries,","which could lead via the vicious circle to more default,","higher interest rates, more defaults, higher interest rates, I could go on like this forever,","which would be very bad, like we would yearn for the days of ten percent unemployment.","All of which is complicated by the fact that we're coming out of a worldwide recession,","and the total economic output of the world is smaller.","So there is less money coming in taxes,","but governments still need to spend approximately the same amount of money.","And for everybody who says that the problem is wasteful government spending,","we aren't even close to a balanced budget.","I mean, the United States would have to eliminate both of its two biggest expenses,","social security and defense,","in order to even come close to balancing the budget.","The only other way to shrink the deficit would to be to raise taxes,","which is not generally seen as a good idea during a recession.","So the problem of sovereign debt may be not being as cheap as it once was.","It isn't the fault of any one political ideology,","it's kind of everybody's fault.","So basically Hank, I don't want to alarm you,","but I do think we should all buy unicorn pinatas and hide our valuables in them.","Actually Hank, the unicorn strategy won't work,","because we have to keep loaning each other money,","and we have to figure out a way to loan confidently,","like we did back in 1945.","That's why the EU and the IMF are working so hard to try to nail down a bailout plan for Greece.","And if fancypants countries can't continue to convince us","that our money is as safe with them as it is inside of a unicorn pinata,","they will lose the cheap money privilege they have enjoyed for centuries.","And history tells us that once a stupid rich man gets poor,","he doesn't usually get rich again unless he is Donald Trump.","Hank, I'll see you on Monday.","Hank, I told you I'll see you on Monday.","That's your signal to stop watching, but nerdfighters,","there's still time to participate in our secret project.","Click here for more info!","Here, I've made it a heart for you.

It's gonna act as the glue for the mix.","Then, you take the chicken tenders, put them in the bag.","You seal it up really well, especially if the kids are helping.","And then, you're gonna have fun shaking up your bag","so that your chicken tenders are completely coated with the Bisquick.","Then, you're gonna take a cooking sheet that's been lined with foil and grease.","You're gonna lay out the chicken tenders.","Bake for twelve to fourteen minutes, flipping about halfway through to make sure you have a nice brown color on both sides.","These chicken tenders are right out of the oven,","look(ing) delicious, and there's no doubt your kids are gonna love them.","The next easy chicken dinner we're gonna make is perfect for having a party: Salsa chicken.","I'm gonna make a smaller batch to show you.","But you can make this really easy dish in only twenty minutes and feed a large group with absolutely no stress.","First, I've taken some chicken, cut into half inch cubes, and I sauteed it so that it was cooked all the way through.","I then poured in some Salsa.","Next, I'm gonna preheat the oven to four hundred.","And now, I'm gonna make my crust using Bisquick, eggs and water.","After that, press the crust into a greased, 9 by 12 pan.","You simply take some shredded cheddar, then you take chicken,","and simply spread it over the crust and the cheese in an even layer.","Then, I'm gonna pop it in the oven. It's gonna bake for about twenty-two to twenty-five minutes.","I added a little more cheese on top, and I popped it back in the oven for a few minutes until it fully melted.","Then, I'm gonna cut it into squares and serve. Salsa chicken.","It's a quick, easy, delicious way to feed a large group.","I'm Cricket Azima, bringing you great ideas from Bretty Crocker with Howdini.","To see more of our videos for easy recipes you can make with your kids or for your family,","visit us at bettycrocker.com/Bisquickideas."],"wordList":["Cooking","chicken","for","your","family","and","friends","has","a","ton","of","advantages","It's","reasonably","priced","healthy","low","fat","and","versatile","But","it","sure","is","easy","to","get","tired","of","the","same","old","chicken","dishes","Hi","I'm","Cricket","Azima","I","wanna","show","you","two","fast","simple","chicken","dinners","that","are","bound","to","be","family","favorites","Kids","and","chicken","fingers","a","classic","love","affair","Why","not","try","a","baked","version","Let","me","show","you","a","really","easy","way","to","make","restaurant","style","chicken","fingers","right","at","home","Start","by","preheating","the","oven","to","four","hundred","and","fifty","degrees","In","a","large","gallon","plastic","bag","start","with","some","Bisquick","then","Parmesan","cheese","salt","and","garlic","salt","and","a","touch","of","Paprika","for","flavor","Then","you're","gonna","take","an","egg","and","lightly","beat","it","Dip","the","chicken","tenders","first","in","the","egg","It's","gonna","act","as","the","glue","for","the","mix","Then","you","take","the","chicken","tenders","put","them","in","the","bag","You","seal","it","up","really","well","especially","if","the","kids","are","helping","And","then","you're","gonna","have","fun","shaking","up","your","bag","so","that","your","chicken","tenders","are","completely","coated","with","the","Bisquick","Then","you're","gonna","take","a","cooking","sheet","that's","been","lined","with","foil","and","grease","You're","gonna","lay","out","the","chicken","tenders","Bake","for","twelve","to","fourteen","minutes","flipping","about","halfway","through","to","make","sure","you","have","a","nice","brown","color","on","both","sides","These","chicken","tenders","are","right","out","of","the","oven","look","ing","delicious","and","there's","no","doubt","your","kids","are","gonna","love","them","The","next","easy","chicken","dinner","we're","gonna","make","is","perfect","for","having","a","party","Salsa","chicken","I'm","gonna","make","a","smaller","batch","to","show","you","But","you","can","make","this","really","easy","dish","in","only","twenty","minutes","and","feed","a","large","group","with","absolutely","no","stress","First","I've","taken","some","chicken","cut","into","half","inch","cubes","and","I","sauteed","it","so","that","it","was","cooked","all","the","way","through","I","then","poured","in","some","Salsa","Next","I'm","gonna","preheat","the","oven","to","four","hundred","And","now","I'm","gonna","make","my","crust","using","Bisquick","eggs","and","water","After","that","press","the","crust","into","a","greased","9","by","12","pan","You","simply","take","some","shredded","cheddar","then","you","take","chicken","and","simply","spread","it","over","the","crust","and","the","cheese","in","an","even","layer","Then","I'm","gonna","pop","it","in","the","oven","It's","gonna","bake","for","about","twenty-two","to","twenty-five","minutes","I","added","a","little","more","cheese","on","top","and","I","popped","it","back","in","the","oven","for","a","few","minutes","until","it","fully","melted","Then","I'm","gonna","cut","it","into","squares","and","serve","Salsa","chicken","It's","a","quick","easy","delicious","way","to","feed","a","large","group","I'm","Cricket","Azima","bringing","you","great","ideas","from","Bretty","Crocker","with","Howdini","To","see","more","of","our","videos","for","easy","recipes","you","can","make","with","your","kids","or","for","your","family","visit","us","at","bettycrocker","com","Bisquickideas"]},{"title":"「Jamie Oliver教你做完美的歐姆雷特」- Jamie Oliver Makes The Perfect Omelette","img":"https://www.hopenglish.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/036.jpg","link":"/jamie-oliver-makes-the-perfect-omelette?ref=search","view_count":"16464","upload_date":"2012-02-03","postId":39,"start_t":null,"end_t":null,"youtubeId":"AgHgbn_sVUw","tags":["歐姆雷特","omelette","美式蛋捲","料理","早餐","breakfast","omelete"],"sentences":["We are gonna do omelettes.","Omelettes are fantastic.","They are cheap.

That's always a great question, isn't it?","And you have to be prepared for the key questions.","Especially, \"Why are you moving on?\"","Now, if you are moving on because you can't stand your boss, right?","Which happens a lot and we've all been there.","You don't wanna say that!","What you do want to say is that I really need to be in a place","where I can be managed and developed and where I can get guidance or mentoring.","You really focus on the things that you are looking to get as opposed to all the reasons why you don't have it now.","You know there are some people who walk into that interview and they walk in a little defensively","and because they really need a job.","And they hear the words,","\"You are overqualified!\" And they are willing to take a job and do their best at it.","How do you handle, \"You are overqualified?\"","You can say things like, \"Well, I've, you know, I've really thought about that","and if I were in your shoes, I'd be asking the same question.","And when I think about it,","I can tell you for a fact,","I'm looking to downshift,","and I know this industry well, and I don't need to be in charge.","I've been the person on the totem pole before and I can do that again.","I'm really looking for a place where I can contribute but where I don't have to be the one who's running the show.\" And r","And really address those concerns which are behind the \"overqualified\" comment.","And they may say the op (opposite), \"You just don't have enough experience for us.\"","Oh, for folks who are just starting out maybe a new career","or college students who just graduated or even folks out of high school","are new to the work world that's a common problem.","So again I go back to, \"internships are great,\"","anyway that you can get some experience on your resume to demonstrate,","\"Hey, yeah, I may not be, you know, ten years in this field, but I can tell you in this...","this experience that I had this summer,","I didn't know anything going in and here is how successful I was.\" Y","You want to show situations where, yeah,","you went in without a lot of experience but were still able to succeed.","And this is where references can be so helpful as well.","Even if you don't have a lot of experience,","anybody can be a good reference for you.","Even a teacher, or a professor, or even, um, someone that you volunteered for,","who can attest your ability to learn quickly and perform well can be a great asset.","\"We already like you.

wondered: What's the big deal about blogs?","This is Blogs in Plain English.","To make sense of blogs, you have to think about the news and who makes it.","We'll look at news in the 20th vs. the 21st century to make our point.","In the 20th century, the news was produced professionally.","When news happened,","reporters wrote the stories and a tiny group of people","decided what appeared in a newspaper or broadcast.","Professional news was main stream: general and limited.","The 21st century","marked the point where news became both professional and personal.","A new kind of website called a Weblog or Blog for short","came onto the scene that let anyone be a reporter and publisher, often for free.","As blogs became popular,","they created millions of news sources","and gave everyone an audience for their own version of news.","Of course, we're using the word \"news\" loosely.","But really, isn't everything news to someone?","With a blog, a business owner can share news about his business,","a mother can share news about her family,","or a sport star can share news with fans.","These people are all \"bloggers.\"","How did this happen?","Well, blogs made sharing news on the web easy.","Anyone with an idea can start a new blog with a click of a button","and share news minutes later.","Here's how blogs work.","Blogs are websites that are organized by blog posts.","These are individual news stories,","like articles in the paper.","Bloggers simply fill out a form like this one to post a new story.","With a click of a button,","the blog post appears at the top of the web page,","just above yesterday's news.","Over time, the blog becomes a collection of these posts,","all archived for easy reference.","Also, each blog post","can become a discussion through comments left by readers.","Blogs make the news a two way street.","But really, the fuss is not about how blogs work.","It's about what people like you do with them that matters.","Let's say you have a blog about green living and outdoor photography.","It reflects your unique perspective.","This helps you build relationships with your readers","and other bloggers with similar interests.","Speaking of relationships, bloggers often work together.","In addition to comments, you'll read each other's posts,","quote each other and link your blogs together.","This creates communities of bloggers that inspire and motivate each other.","Whether it's their ease of use or the opportunities they offer,","blogs have been adopted in a very big way.","Since 2003, there have been over seventy million blogs created,","each with its own version of news.","So, the big deal about blogs is that they gave people like you the power of the media","and created a personal kind of news","that appeals to a high number of small audiences.","So, it's up to you.","What will you do with this new power?","There is likely a group of people out there who want to hear what you have to say.","You can search for blogs

night also marked the Keltic New Year and was considered the time \"between years,\" a magical time when the ghost of the dead watched the Earth.","It was the time when the veil between death and life was supposed to be at its thinnest.","On \"Samhain,\" the villagers gathered and lit huge bonfires to drive the dead back to the spirit world and keep them away from the living.","But, as the Catholic Church's influences grew in Europe, it frowned on the pagan rituals like \"Samhain.\"","In the 7th century, the Vatican began to merge it with the church-sanctioned holiday.","So November 1st was designated \"All Saints' Day\" to honor martyrs and the deceased faithful.","Both of these holidays had to do with the afterlife and about survival after death.","It was a calculated move on the part of the Church to bring more people into the fold.","\"All Saints' Day\" was known then as \"Hallowmas.\"","\"Hallow\" means \"holy\" or \"saintly\", so the translation is roughly \"Mass of the Saints.\"","The night before October 31st was \"All Hallows' Eve,\"","which gradually morphed into \"Halloween.\"","The holiday came to America with the wave of Irish immigrants during the Potato Famine of the 1840s.","They brought several of their holiday customs with them,","including \"Bobbing for Apples\" and playing tricks on neighbors, like removing gates from the front of houses.","The young pranksters were masked, so they wouldn't be recognized.","But over the years, the tradition of harmless tricks grew into outright vandalism.","Back in the 1930s, it really became a dangerous

This can be very very common.","If you walk into her room that she is on her own.","You come sit by her and whatever. She notices that it's you.","She might do something called \"preening,\" or she might fluff up her hair,","she might adjust her clothing, she might redo her makeup.","And this can be a very definite sign that she likes you,","because she is trying to look good for you, make sure that she is looking pretty enough for you or whatever.","Second sign is when...when you talk to her (this is a pretty obvious sign...)","When you talk to her,","she might blush, she might stutter,","or you know, nervous, stuffs like that.","She gets all frigidy. You know, just simple things like that.","The third sign is if she holds your gaze longer than an average person a lot or shorter.","So if you look at her and she looks away quickly,","not turns her whole head, but you know what I mean.","If she moves away from your eye contact very quickly,","this could definitely show that she likes you, or if she tries to hold it longer than most people.","The fourth thing is if she kind of plays like a damsel in distress.","Like if you are with her,","for example, you may be outside and it's very cold out,","and she will give subtle hints that she is cold and that she wants a jacket.","Well, this is kind of her saying that \"Lend me your jacket,\" you know, something like that.","The fifth sign is very common,","but it may not be an exact way to tell if a girl likes you or not,","because some people are just a bit more touchy-feely people.","But usually when a girl likes you,","she is going to touch your arm a lot when she talks to you;","she is going to brush against you, do anything to kind of,","you know, touch you, and let you know that she's there.","The sixth thing is that she might show up (at) places where you are going.","It's not a coincidence.","It's really not. Let's say,","she...you and her were talking one day at school.","And you mentioned that you were going to stop by a restaurant on Thursday, four o'clock, for dinner,","something like that.","Well, she's probably going to get one of her friends,","and go there at the same exact time that you are.","And that is a very, very, very obvious thing.","The seventh thing is","if you notice when she's around her friends and you are around with them,","if her friends giggle at you a lot and make fun of her like,","\"Oh, blah blah blah...\" \"Look at him!\" You know, something like that.","This is a sure sign that she likes you.","The eighth sign is pretty obvious again.","If she asks you a lot about a girlfriend,","or what's your preference in girls,","or you know, she might do something like pull off a picture of a girl and be like,","\"Oh, isn't she super pretty?\"","and she might try to wait for your response and see if you say,","\"Oh, you are prettier,\" something like that.","Another sign and this is a fool-proof sign,","but it's when... Let's say,","if you have friends over, she gets in,","she flirts with your friends in front of you,","or she talks about the boyfriend that she doesn't have.","You know, stuffs that kind of spark jealousy,","to see if you were responding in jealousy manners.","So then she can tell whether, you know, you like her or not.","You know, it might be anything from talking about how hot a movie star is,","to flirting with your best friends.","So it really depends.","And then another thing to look for and this is fool-proof either.","But if she posts up like a picture of a really pretty friend that she has or that you have,","a mutual friend or something,","and she talks about how pretty she is.","Well, that's her kind of saying like,","\"Oh, are you going to comment me then,\"","and say, you know, \"Am I that pretty?\" or, you know,","she's hoping that you'll say,","\"Oh, I thought you are way prettier,\" or something like that.","Alright, well, I hope that these signs help you guys figure out whether she likes you or not.","And if (you) have any more questions, common below or send me messages. Okay, bye-bye!","Oh, and I just wanna say that, these are not scientific. They are not.","I have done some researches,","and I...I'm not a psychologist,","I wanna major in psychology,","but I'm not at any point near.","And these are just from personal experience,","from my research done, and from, like my friends talking,","stuffs like just observing being a girl.","So, alright, you have a good night.

Add here accessories if you want to.","Here it is all done.","If you have straight hair, this will look really nice.","And if you have curly hair, you might have to straighten your hair first,","because I've never tried this on curly hair before.","This is another cute hairstyle that is extremely easy to do.","First, I'm going to create a little pompadour above my head","by just grabbing some hair and adding as much as I want to it.","So I'm just going to grab some more from each side.","Then I'm going to push my hair forward to create a little bump,","and with bobby pins, I'm going to pin that part down.","I'd like to use two bobby pins and cross them together to keep the bump in place.","Now I'm going to gather my hair all to one side,","and braid this section into a regular three-strand braid.","You can even do a fishtail braid,","but if you are really pressed for time, then a regular three-strand braid will suffice.","Now I'm going to use my small elastic band and tie the ends off.","Then I'm just going to stretch out the braid to make it look fuller and bigger.","So I'm just going to tug on each strand.","If you have a layer hair like I do, all you have to do is just pin the strands back so that everything will look neat.","I'm also going to use a flower pin to just pin my front layer away.","And that's the completed look.","I used to wear my hair like this all the time, especially when the pompadour was really in.","But I haven't done it for a while so it was nice to do it again.","And lastly we have the Messy High Bun.","If you prefer low buns, just tie your hair lower.","But for me, I'm going to do a higher bun.","So I'm going to just make the really high ponytail,","and since I like it on the side, I'm going to position the ponytail on the side.","To add more buns into my hair, I'm going to back comb the ponytail with just a regular comb.","And you don't need any hairspray, because this is gonna go into a bun later.","When that's done, just grab the ponytail, and twist it around into a circle.","Then just wrap them around each other.","Then grab a tiny little elastic band and just put that overall back here.","And this will give you a really messy look.","If you don't want your bun too big, just connect it down with some bobby pins.","Add a flower, clip to complete the look and we're done.","So here's the front and the back of the bun.","It's really messy.","This is also the hairstyle I sported in that milkshake video and some people are asking about it.","I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial and I will talk to you in my

I've decided to put together a video that","instead of just showing you how to spin a pencil, I'll actually teach you how to spin a pencil.","So let's get started with the basics. We're gonna start with just going Once Around.","As you can see, I'm only using three fingers, the index finger, the middle finger and the thumb.","And the pencil is off-center and that most of the weight is off to the left side of the screen here.","What I am gonna do is I'm gonna push the pencil around my thumb,","and then catch it between my index finger and thumb.","And you'll see that the weight shift goes from the left side to the middle when I catch it.","And then when I do it again, I have to kind of shift the weight back to the left.","Not only is this technique essential for the more advanced stuff I'm about to show you,","but you can also use it to spin anything that's even, similarly shaped to a pen or pencil that's lying around your house,","such as a screwdriver or even something as crazy as a banana.","Note that I'm using the same basic techniques here.

Vsause. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about yawning.","Why do we yawn? And why is yawning contagious? How come when I see someone yawn or even think about it makes me kind of want to yawn?","First things first: definitions. When you yawn, you inhale air and stretch your eardrums. That's why your ears pop when you yawn.","Now, if you yawn and at the same time stretch your whole body, that is called pandiculation.","A common misconception about yawning is that people yawn when they need more air, more oxygen,","but studies have shown that no matter how much oxygen is in the air around the person, they won't yawn more or less frequently.","And when people exercise and their bodies do in fact need more oxygen, they don't yawn more often.","Instead, research has shown that our first answer most likely lies in being cool.","When you are exhausted, tired, deep brain temperatures increase. But your brain is like a computer. It operates best at a very specific temperature.","And so, yawning, bringing all this outside air in through your ears and your mouth cools your facial blood and actually helps cool down your brain.","This phenomenon is particularly easy to observe when parakeets yawn.","Researchers have found that parakeets only yawn within a very specific range of temperatures.","Too cold outside, an yawning would cool the brain too much; too hot, an yawning would actually warm it up.","Parakeets are perfect test subjects for this effect, because they yawn just like you and me except they don't exhibit contagious yawning.","If you show a person a video of other people yawing, it's likely that the person watching will yawn his or her self,","unless you put an ice pack on their forehead keeping their brain cooler.","Seriously, the University of Albany has found that people contagiously yawn less frequently when they have ice packs on their head,","which means that yawning to cool your brain isn't just for the birds.","Studies have shown that yawning also increases blood pressure, stretches facial muscles, and increases focus.","When you pandiculate, you stretch all of your muscles, making them better ready to be used at any moment.","So when it comes to a herd of prey animals, contagious yawning makes sense, because a herd that yawns together stays alert together.","Under this theory, yawning is advantageously contagious,","because that first animal to yawn acts as a sort of reminder to the rest of the herd to keep themselves ready and alert.","But of course, when we say that yawning is contagious, we don't mean like a disease. Instead, it's a bit more closely related to empathy.","Sympathy is when you are concerned for others, where you wish someone is better off.","Empathy is the ability to recognize and share the emotions that other people feel.","Emotional contagion is when the emotions of people around you influence the way you feel without you even having to separate yourselves from them,","like when being around happy people lifts your spirit, or how anger and fear can lead to mob mentality.","Now, children with autism who exhibit impaired social interaction and communication","yawn less frequently than other children when viewing videos of people yawning.","So is yawning an emotional contagion, or is it about empathy?","Last year, the University of Pisa found that yawn contagiousness is greatest with family, and then friends, and then acquaintances and lastly, strangers.","And a study at Leeds University brought in participants to take a test that measure how empathetic they were.","But before the test began, amongst them was one person who worked for the researchers, and this person yawned every minute for ten minutes.","Interestingly, the people who wound up scoring the highest on the empathy test were also the ones who contagiously yawn the most.","Let's talk more about animal yawning.","What fascinates me so much is that animals across many species all yawn, but they do so for different reasons.","Animals like guinea pigs and some monkeys yawn to intimidate and show their sharp, scary teeth. Some penguins yawn to attract mates.","And when snakes yawn, it seems to be about realigning their jaws and opening their tracheas to breathe better after a big body-disfiguring meal.","Fish yawn more frequently when water oxygen levels are low, or water heat levels are high.","So when you yawn, you're participating in the behavior shared across all kinds of animals,","but most likely you're yawning for purposes unique to your species, us humans.","And what's really cool is that yawning is most likely an ancient signal telling the rest of us humans: \"Let's do this! Let's survive!\"","And as always, thanks for

The secret here is not to try to throw the food up and catch it.","That's why people have a problem with this.","They think they're supposed to throw the food up, and then somehow catch it with a pan.","That's not what you're trying to do. It's not an up-and-down motion. It's a back-and-forth motion.

I was like, \"What is going on?\"","A nine-year-old boy now has a huge college fund. He's the talk of the town. Is he a future billionaire?","What's next for this precocious nine-year-old?","The video came out on Monday. Nearly two million people have watched it.","By Saturday, we had four-hour lines waiting to play Caine's Arcade. When a little boy's dream came to life...","We finally got some customers here. I told my dad that was the best day of my life.","Celebrities were tweeting. Caine's Arcade was trending on Twitter worldwide.","It hit the front page of Reddit, and people started coming from around the world to visit Caine's Arcade.","U.K, London, Spain...everywhere! They've been flying and taking taxis from the airport directly to Caine's Arcade.","Jack Black even came by with his kids to play.","But for me, the most inspiring thing was the wave of cardboard creativity inspired in kids around the world.","Hi, Caine. This is me, Jojo Roman from facebook. I fanned you, and this is my bubblegum machine.","My game is called Basketball Groove, and if you get all four balls in you get a pencil. Cool prize, Abby!","It's called Tilta-Ball. It's made with Popsicle sticks. Thanks Isaac for the game. You're welcome!","Oh, my name is Erza, and I made this pinball machine. And I got the idea by watching a video from my dad's computer.","I also made a coin slot. I get ten tries. Yeah!!!","I made a same game as...like this, but everything is different.","Come on, Beau! Beau wants to go in the car wash too.","Nice! Awesome!","Try my scanner. I'm just getting a paper, okay? Okay!","That's cool!","And I love your arcade. I'm... Man, I don't know what to say. You're just famous.","Caine has grown a lot. I mean, first of all, he's literally grown a lot.","He's probably outgrown two staff shirts, and we had to make him a boss shirt.","I'm the boss. Ugh...there's a lot of work.","Caine has really come out of the shell. He talks to everybody freely now.","And he doesn't stutter anymore. And he's doing way better at school.","One of the things that I've learned from this experience is how a small gesture can change the life of a child.","And to think that there are so many other kids like Caine out there,","who just need somebody to come in and buy a Fun Pass.","So we started the Imagination Foundation.","So the Imagination Foundation's mission is to find, foster and fund creativity and entrepreneurship in kids like Caine.","I see a lot of promise in the Imagination Foundation as a way of advocacy for kids' interests.","One of the greatest challenges I think we face in education is tapping into children's natural powers of creativity.","And one of the appeals of Caine's Arcade is its demonstrating how deep those powers are,","and how readily people will rise to the challenge if you give it to them.","It's not enough anymore just to learn the basic kinds of language arts and math skills.","Our children need to be innovators and inventors.","I think if we can make that systemic in our education systems,","we'll transform the world for our children and for ourselves.","After we started the foundation, the first thing we did is we hit the ground running with the school pilot program.","Within the first two months, over a hundred schools in nine countries participated","using project based learning to teach kids math, science and engineering.","I told Caine that when I was a kid, I also built cardboard rockets.","These were space capsules that we can actually fly in our backyard.","And here I am, many years later, and I'm still building space craft,","but this one: a real one that landed on Mars.","So the idea is not only to give kids the tools to build the things that they can imagine,","but to also imagine the world that they can build.","Are these the flames shooting out the back of the ship? Yeah, I think we're gonna put a big flame.","Childhood imagination will take you from cardboard to this in just a few years.","Ready for liftoff?

to cardboardchallenge.com and sing up to host an event or find an event near you.","If you want, you can set a fundraising goal to help support the Imagination Foundation.","Then invite everyone you know to come out and play.","No matter how old you are, all you need is cardboard and imagination.","You can build an arcade, a robot, a rocket ship...anything that you can imagine.","There are some events already being planned in kitchens in Idaho, school districts across Texas.","There's a Cardboard Amazement Park being planned in Kampala.","The idea is just to bring the whole world together to play and celebrate creativity and imagination.","For me, this all started with a door handle, and I ended up buying a Fun Pass.","And for Caine, it started with the small basketball hoop that he won

This is Misterduncan in England.","How are you today? Are you ok? I hope so! Are you happy? I hope so!","In this lesson, we'll take a look at the two sides or faces of how we can feel emotionally","and the way these feelings affect both ourselves and the people around us.","In today's lesson, we'll look at being happy and feeling sad.","We all have feelings.","They are the individual parts of our character that show the way we feel, depending on the situations around us.","When we say feelings, we are actually describing one feeling at a time.","Although sometimes, for example, due to illness, a person may experience many feelings at once.","The way you feel relates to your \"Emotional State, Mood, Frame of Mind, Temper, Disposition, State of Mind, Spirit\".","Good or bad can be added to all of these words to show a positive mood and a negative one.","Our feelings and moods are all related to the way we think in our minds.","The study of this subject is called \"Psychology.\"","This also covers the way we behave generally.","Our minds control everything we do.","Besides actions, your mood can also affect your health.","If you were to feel unhappy over a long period of time, then you may need to see a doctor.","You could be suffering from \"Depression.\"","This is often caused by stress from a sudden change in your life,","such as the loss of your job, or the death of a loved one.","It may sound strange to some people, but your mood can be affected by the weather.","Psychologists have found that a chemical imbalance in the brain can cause us to feel sad,","when there is little sunlight about.","Those affected will feel happier and more content during the summer time,","while during the short winter days, they may find themselves becoming depressed and gloomy.","This feeling even has a name: S. A. D. (Seasonal Affective disorder).","It is amazing how our moods can change from day to day.","You may find yourself jumping for joy on Monday, and feeling down in the doldrums by Friday.","There are many idioms for feeling happy and sad.","\"Happy as Larry\": To be very happy.","\"Jump for Joy\": To show your happiness.","\"Smile from Ear to Ear\": A happy face.","\"Happy go Lucky\": A cheerful person.","\"On Top of the World\": So very happy.","\"Down in the Dumps\": To feel unhappy.","\"Under a Black Cloud\": Sad and depressed.","\"In the Doldrums\": To feel sad and gloomy.","There are many different things around us that have the ability to change the way we feel.","A piece of classical music might make you feel sad. It touches you emotionally. It moves you.","A happy story may uplift your mood and cheer you up.","You may find yourself both laughing and crying, while watching a romantic movie, either alone or with your lover.","There is an expression in English that goes, \"Laughter is the best medicine.\"","This means that when you are feeling unhappy or down, or even unwell,","the only way to get out of that mood is to watch something humorous on the television.","Make a funny face in the mirror.","Laugh out loud until all your blues have gone away!","Happiness","I feel happy. I feel glad. I feel excited. I never feel sad.","The day is alive, and I feel great. Tomorrow will be good. I just can't wait.","My heart is warm with a rosy glow. The smile on my face, I love to show.","I need to jump. I like to sing. I want to live. I love everything.","Sadness","I feel down. I feel bad. I feel miserable. I really feel sad.","I hate this day. I dislike it all. My heart is down. Feel like I will fall.","So grey is this world, with its trouble and strife. So cold (is) my spirit, in this dark and gloomy life.","In British English we use the word \"Sad\" informally as a way of describing something that is unfashionable,","or a person who appears to have no friends or any social life.","\"That style of fashion is so sad.\"","\"He never goes out anywhere, and he has no friends. What a saddo!!\"","We can use the words Happy and Sad and their synonyms to show our reactions to something or someone.","\"I'm really happy to meet you.\"","\"I'm glad to have you as my friend.\"","\"I feel brighter now you are here.\"","\"I feel sad now that you have gone.\"","\"I feel down because I hate my job.\"","\"I feel sick and my spirits are low.\"","Happy Synonyms: Bright, Content, Cheerful, Elated, Glowing, Jolly, Joyful, Merry, Sunny.","Sad Synonyms: Blue, Forlorn, Depressed, Down, Gloomy, Glum, Moody, Solemn, Woeful.","It would be fair to say that we all go through times when things seem bad.","People can sometimes let you down.","They have the ability to say things that make you unhappy.","Events and circumstances may come along and destroy your plans for the future.","As the poet Stephen Spender once wrote, \"You must live through the time when everything hurts.\"","Life comes with no guarantees or promises.","The sunny days of contentment can only be truly appreciated through the dark gloomy nights of despair.","For without sadness, we would never really know what it is like to be truly happy.","Well, that's all I have time for today,","but don't

This is Melody. Today I'm going to be doing my first tag video, which is the What's in My Purse video.","This bag is by Samantha Thavasa, and I got this in Japan.","And it's also a two-way bag that you can use by holding onto the straps, or you can use it as a shoulder bag, and this is also removable.","So I take the shoulder strap off so you can see the bag better, and it looks like this.","There's ribbons on both sides. I really love the details.","So there's a front pouch and I have two bag accessories.","And this one is actually not just a regular bag accessory but something very useful. So I'm gonna show you how to use it right now.","This is actually a bag holder.","So I'm going to flip it to the back, and there's this magnetic piece that goes around it, and I'm going to take it off.","So now it should be like an upside down C-curve, and I'm going to place this on the edge of my table.","Then I'm going to hook my bag right onto this thing.","And it should hold your bag really nicely.","This bag holder comes in handy especially when you are eating at a restaurant or something so you don't have to put your bag on the floor.","And it's also really cute to keep it at the side of the table, or use it as a bag accessory anyways.","So that's how it's used.","So when I open up my bag, it looks like this.","I'd like to keep my stuff in my bag organized, so each category has its own compartment, and I'm gonna start off with this pocket right here.","So the first thing in the pocket is this cardholder.","It has my MetroCard in it, which is used to ride the New York City subways.","And each freight is $2.25, and it doesn't matter from where to where you go. It's all going to be $2.25.","And the other side is clear, so you can put your monthly pass in it, but today I have this Japanese Suica Card to show you.","I was using this Suica Card when I was travelling in Tokyo.","And what's cool about this is that you don't have to swipe it or anything toward a machine.","You can just \"Beep\" it onto the machine, and it will let you through.","And it also works by having it at the bottom of your bag, like inside your bag as well. So that's the Suica Card.","The next thing in my pocket is my tissue and handkerchief, and it's Winnie the Pooh.","And the last thing in this pocket is my wallet.","I keep all my cards here, and since I shop at Sephora a lot, I'm a Beauty Insider VIP.","Moving along to another pocket, I have my iPhone 4, and I have a Rilakkuma iPhone case.","If you can see the slot right here, it actually opens up.","Then you can set it like this on a table or whatever you want,","if you want to watch a TV show with someone else, or if you are talking with someone through the iPhone.","I also usually have this Minnie Mouse cellphone strap on here, and it's the cutest thing. It's like a little sleeping Minnie Mouse.","And I got this at Shibuya in Tokyo. And her belly actually also works as a screen thinner.","In the pocket next to my iPhone, I have my charger, and this works with any iPod series or iPhone series.","I carry this battery charger with me all the time, because then I don't have to worry about my iPhone running out of battery or having to charge it outside.","It's also very thin and light.","You press this bottom here. It actually lightens up so it tells you how much of the battery is left in order to charge your phone.","This is another product that I found in Japan, and it's very unique and useful. It's a solar iPhone charger.","If your iPhone battery dies, and if your extra charger also runs out of battery,","as long as you have this, and the sun is out, you can keep charging this and keep charging your phone.","What I love about Japan is that they have the coolest electronic devices that you can never find anywhere else.","They are so unique and high-tech, and they are also very small and fashionable to carry with you.","These are some of my other favorite iPhone cases, and these are the rhinestone ones.","I really recommend buying rhinestone iPhone cases in Japan, because I find in a lot of the American ones, the rhinestones fall off very easily and fast.","This is my newest iPhone 4 case that I bought in Japan, and it's the One Piece and Hello Kitty collaboration one.","If you would like to know where you can find these iPhone cases in Japan, I will let you know on my website blog.","And I'm a huge music lover, so I'm always listening to music 24/7, so I have my pink earphones with me all the time.","And this one actually has a mic as well, just like the regular iPhone earphones.","So now all the pockets are done. So I'm gonna go in to show you my makeup pouch.","I'm not sure if you can see it, but there's a lot of sequences on here, so it kinda sparkles when I move it around.","And I'm gonna open it up with this thing.","So first I have my mirror, and it kind of matches my makeup pouch.","I didn't buy them together, but...","I have my contact lens cases and solution, in case I need to take it out or something outside.","I also get a lot of questions on what color lens I wear where I actually don't wear any at all, because my eyes are very sensitive.","I just wear my regular contact lenses.","I also have this portable eyelash glue.","I don't wear eyelashes every day, but I have this with me just in case.","What's nice about this one is that it's not like a brush. It's more like a stick, so you can just kinda glide it across your, um, eyelash.","That's very nice and thin.","I also always carry this redness relief eye drop with me, because like I said, my eyes are very sensitive.","So now, I'm gonna show you the makeup stuff that I carry in here.","So this is one of my favorite and coolest products I found in Japan last month when I visited.","It's a portable powder foundation applicator by a brand called Chasty.","So it comes with the lid and when you open it, there's the brush. And then there's a pump right here, so when you press it, the powder comes out.","The brush is also very very soft.","So just by having this, you can buff your own on top of your makeup if you need to,","without having to carry a compact and a sponge or a kabuki brush with you.","So, you also don't have to worry about your powder foundation spilling all over the place, or your powder foundation cracking or anything like that,","because it's all in here.","The brush will also not get messed up, because you can close it up, and then put the lid right on top.","And the lid will also help keep the brush stay clean.","And the only other makeup products that I carry with me outdoors are my favorite liquid eyeliner and lipstick.","I use both of these in my AKB48 Give Me Five dance, and make it a tutorial video, which is my last video.","I carry this with me outdoors, just in case I need to darken up my makeup or anything like that.","This lipstick is Maybelline New York. It's the Pure Shiny Diamond.","This product is very shiny and glossy, so I can just go with this without putting any gloss on top of it.","But if I want to add a little bit more shine, then I also carry my Dior Kiss with me.","And the last item in my makeup pouch is this hair product, which I show in my Must-Have Japanese Beauty Products video.","This stick is very useful, because then you can calm down the hairs without having to put any kind of gel or spray stuff onto your fingers.","In the morning I try to apply my makeup so that it lasts throughout the day, even after all the dancing.","So that's why I don't really carry that many products with me outside.","Then I have my thermos, because I always try to keep myself hydrated, and I carry tea or water in here most of the time.","This one is cool because it has a lock right here, and when I open it and press, it opens up.","It works for both hot and cold drinks, so I'd like to carry this with me all times.","Then I have my umbrella, because especially in New York, during the summer, it rains all of a sudden.","I also gave this one away to my eleven New York City and Japan products give away winner.","Next, I have the cutest Winnie the Pooh pouch.","So cute!","This is actually the same series as my Minnie Mouse cell phone strap. And it's the sleeping Pooh Bear and the Sleeping Minnie Mouse.","It also comes with two straps to tighten up the top part.","This red bag contains, um, girl products, so I'm going to set this aside.","I have Band-Aids. I carry this sawing kit with me in case I need to saw anything.","I also carry my Purell hand sanitizer with me all the time, because I always use the transportation system in New York City.","And then I also have my keys and other small products in here, but the last other thing that I have is my Advil and Tylenol.","I always carry this pack with me, because you never know when you or your friend might get a headache or cramps.","So if you need Tylenol or Advil just let me know, because I'll always have this with me.","And the very last thing in my bag is this. I don't carry it with me all the time, but I did today, so I'll show you.","It is my pointe shoes.","I have a new pair here in my bag today, because I just sewed them.","We try to make them as soft as possible by hammering it, um, putting it under doors, and breaking it,","so that it fits the size and shape of your feet, because everyone's feet are shaped differently.","I just want to quickly show you in this video, because I thought it'd be kind of interesting to show you what pointe shoes look like.","So that is it for my What's In My Bag video. I hope you guys enjoy it.","If you like additional details of some of the parts that I show you and where you can get them, etcetera, please visit my website at danceandmelodee.com.","I hope you guys have a great weekend.

about?","We don't actually know for sure what started the celebration of April Fools Day.","References can be found as early as 1500s, but these accounts are infrequent and not very detailed.","Most popular theories had begun around 1582 in France during the reformation of the calendar.","Before France adopted the Gregorian calendar, they celebrated the New Years for eight days, beginning on March 25th, and ending on April 1st.","When they switch calendar system, the eighth day moved from April 1st to January 1st.","Because they didn't have internet, phones, social media and a mail system, a lot of people didn't hear about this change until years later.","Those who did not hear about the change continued to celebrate New Years in April.","Others refused to celebrate out of rebellion.","Those who had been informed of the change and adjusted their calendars began to make fun of these fools who were uninformed or rebellious.","This harassment evolved into a tradition of playing pranks on the first day of April, and then spread to other countries.","However, April Fools Day was already established in England, which didn't switch calendar system until 1752.","Also people are already engaging in pranks and light-heartedness around this time of year, long before the French switch their calendar systems,","such as in the case of the ancient Roman festival of Hilaria.","Modern celebrations of April Fools Day have slightly different traditions, depending on the country you are in.","But they all have the similar theme of pranking or humiliating individuals.","In France, they try to tape an image of fish to your back without you noticing.","And in Portugal, they throw flour at you.","In England, you are always supposed to pull jokes until noon, and if you pull a joke after noon, you are called an April Fool.","And in the United States and Britain, even popular media outlets and companies have been known to get involved in the fun.","In 1996, Taco Bell announced that it had purchased the Liberty Bell from the city of Philadelphia, and it was going to rename it as Taco Liberty Bell.","In 1992, NPR claimed that Richard Nixon would be running again for president.","British publication, theguardian, famously pranked the public in 1977,","when they said that a Semicolon shaped island in the Indian Ocean had been discovered.","This hoax is credited for launching the trend of April Fools Day pranks by British tabloids.","So hopefully you now know a little more about the history of April Fools Day, or at least what we think the

and famine.","Greedy money lenders victimized local villagers who wanted to start small businesses.","In one village, Muhammad Yunus counted forty-two people who needed just twenty-seven dollars to break out of poverty.","So then an idea came to my mind:","if I give these twenty-seven dollars to all these forty-two people, they can return the money to the money lender, so they'll be free.","And that's what exactly ended.","And the happiness that they brought to them caught me in.","And I ask myself the question: if you can make so many people so happy with such a small amount of money, why shouldn't you do it more?","Since that first bet, the bank Muhammad Yunus started has made nearly five billion dollars in loans.","It's a model that has been copied all over the world, spawning a movement known as \"microfinance.\"","People are demonstrably better off in the world today by virtue of that simple insight.","The small, unsecured loans can really make a difference.","Microfinance during the past twenty-five years has demonstrated that millions and millions of people can participate in society in a normal way.","In 2006, Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize: testimony to the role of a new kind of change agent, the social entrepreneur.","Social entrepreneurs like Muhammad Yunus see opportunities where other people see hopeless failures.","They see potential where other people see tragic consequences. They see a future that others can't even begin to imagine.","In this moment in history, where government has, at least in some places, has failed to provide basic goods and services,","the things that societies need to really allow individuals to thrive.","Social entrepreneurs are tackling those really big problems:","Problems that reach beyond microfinance, such as educational opportunity, children's health, housing, clean water, climate change.","And the problem is if you look at what the current business, organizations and governments are doing in this sort of space,","it really doesn't add up to a coherent solution of the scale that we need.","Therefore, I think entrepreneurs are going to be profoundly necessary, because here's the people who used to break up the concrete.","Most people have to see to believe, but I think that social entrepreneurs believe, and then they see.","Social entrepreneurs have seen that end result before even got started.","And they've done so all over the world.","In Mozambique, Blaise Judja-Sato transformed health care","by providing reliable medical services to millions of villagers who have never previously been reached.","In India, Bunker Roy's Barefoot College teaches people with no prior training to build and install solar electric technologies.","And in the United States, Dorothy Stoneman has shown how young people can change their lives and their communities through job training and education.","We had three hundred abandoned buildings in East Harlem where I lived.","We had hundreds, maybe thousands of young people standing on the corners with nothing to do, and lots of homeless people.","So I looked at that. I thought there's something wrong with this picture.","Someone should hire these young people to rebuild these buildings and create housing for the homeless people, and that's what we set out to do.","What's those powerful force you can bring to bear is a really big idea,","but only if it's in the hands of a really good entrepreneur, it's not combination that changes the world.","Today, thousands of social entrepreneurs are tackling a range of problems in all corners of the globe,","but until recently, few of them saw themselves as part of a larger movement.","Some twenty years ago, social entrepreneurs were working alone,","fundamentally they had no idea many times that other social entrepreneur existed.","They had an experience of essentially going against stream. Very hard. These are very tough people, but still, alone.","I think social entrepreneurs have always existed,","but because they haven't always been defined as social entrepreneurs, because we've not always recognized them as such, they've had no collective identity.","They have been lone pioneers.","And now what you see in the world are a whole framework of supports that are coming up, coalescing very very quickly","to say, \"Hey, social entrepreneurship is very viable.\"","Oxford recruits about three hundred highly talented MBA students each year.","Students want to know how to change the world. They want to know how the skills they learn in business school can help them change the world.","When you see social entrepreneurs, regardless of how many problems and challenges that they have, they don't give up.","They just push forward and they push forward, and that's inspiring to me.","Today, Oxford is just one of the many universities teaching social entrepreneurship","and providing homes where practicing entrepreneurs can meet and learn from each other.","The point of supporting the social entrepreneurship movement is to create a home for those people to make them less maverick and more of a movement.","The more we wire the field together from local to national to global means that ideas go from Bangladesh to the US and Brazil, Poland to South Africa.","That wasn't happening ten years ago. That's a function of the increased productivity at the field.","I think the key thing that we have to come back to time and time again is these entrepreneurs cannot do this on their own.","They need support. They need support from funders clearly, but they need strategic partnerships with that mainstream business,","and they need the support of government and policymakers.","What's so exciting to be alive at this moment, as a social entrepreneur connected to thousands of social entrepreneurs around the globe,","is that within all of us there's this growing movement,","and that there's a hopefulness in starting to look at the problems we have as our problems.","My hope for the future is that by virtue of the stories that we tell about reasons for optimism, by virtue of the small pieces of

Maybe catch up with you again soon?\"","\"Hey, I would love to stop and chat, but I really have to dash.\"","This type of greeting is common these days, because we are all in such a big hurry to get some place fast.","We sometimes use the word \"hello\" as a way of showing surprise,","or as a way of expressing a sudden interest in something.","\"Hello. What's going on here?\"","\"Hello! I did not know he had a girlfriend.\"","\"Hello. What's going on over there?\"","\"Hello. Something is wrong here.

How are the kids?\"","In China, people will often greet each other by asking if they have eaten their lunch or dinner,","or ask them where they are going.","The word \"hello\" can also be used informally, as a way of expressing sarcasm or annoyance.","\"Hello!
