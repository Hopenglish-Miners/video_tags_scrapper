It's great to be here.","Our pleasure. Ok, our goal for today is to help our audience become better leaders","by simultaneously excelling in four areas of their life, work, home, community, and self.","Right.","So let's begin by allowing me to play devil's advocate.","We're talking about work here. Why do I care about the other three areas?","Why care about your family, society, and your private self—your mind and body and spirit—when your primary focus is work?","Well, the most important reason is that these other parts of your life affect your work.","So how things are going at work, or in your private sphere of mind, body and spirit","and your sense of contribution to society or to your friendship networks, your social groups—all that affects your performance at work.","And one of the things that we've found is that the more you can bring the whole person in,","the more energy, the more productivity, the more commitment, loyalty and focus you have at work.","So it makes business sense to account for the whole person's interests and passions.","Is what we're talking about here work-life balance? Or is there something more to it than that?","A lot of people talk about work-life balance—","many more people today than when I first started addressing this issue 20 years ago when my first son was born.","And it's become a very present issue in many different sectors of our society and abroad. And there's a lot of important reasons for that.","But balance is the wrong metaphor.","Balance is the wrong metaphor because it implies trade-offs.","It implies that you've got to give up one part of your life to have success in another part.","And what I want to encourage people to do is to see the possibility of what I call \"four-way wins,\"","which requires that you use leadership to better integrate the different parts of your life, all four—work, home, community and self;","and to generate the support that you need from the key people around you for making change,","creating meaningful, sustainable change in how, where, and when you get things done","so that it's better for you and better for the different people in the different parts of your life.","And what I find is that when you do that, when you take an approach that is not about trading off or balancing","but rather integrating in an intelligent way that fits your life, your world, that actually works.","So help me out here. I'm like a lot of members of our audience, so I'm sure I was brought up with a mentality that life is about trade-offs,","that you do have to be willing to sacrifice in one area to excel in another.","So let's get specific here. Help us understand how to take that leap to this new mentality.","It starts with being real, which means understanding what really matters to you.","And so there's a couple of really fun and interesting ways of doing that:","looking at your core values, looking at your future. What's the legacy you want to leave for the world 20 years hence?","What are the most important parts of your life today in terms of work, home, community and self?","So you take the \"four-way view\" and see, well, which of these parts are really most important to me?","And where do I focus my time and attention? And how are things going in each of the different domains?","So all that is part of being real, what really matters.","The second piece, be whole, is about understanding the needs and interests—","what I call the performance expectations—of the key stakeholders, the most important people in your life, in the different parts of your life.","See, you think about and write about who the most important people are and what your mutual expectations are,","at work, at home, in the community, and for yourself in terms of your own mental health, physical health,","and a spiritual growth and development, and leisure.","And see, you have a new perspective on \"Where now can I create sustainable change?\"","\"Where now can I experiment with how to bring the different parts together in a way that produces a four-way win?\"","So that's the third part: be innovative.","Act with creativity by experimenting with how you do things.","And so the fun part is experimenting.","So what kinds of experiments do people do?","Well, they range from changing the where and when of getting things done—","what I call time-shifting or replacing—working at home a day a week for example;","or in a more micro scale, focusing and concentrating experiments","where you shut off your Blackberry from the hours of 6 to 10 pm a couple of nights a week,","and see what benefits that brings for the different domains of your life, the different areas;","or there's the example that I write about in the article:","a man who was new to his community and was working in a financial services company","wanted to become a high potential for executive promotion in his company,","and also wanted to join a community board that would involve his fiancee who is very interested in community service activities,","and would also connect him more closer with his sister who is a special education teacher.","So his experiment was to join this community board and to extend his network in a professional context in the community.","Of course the bank saw that as it was good for them. And it was also good for his family as well as for himself and his community.","So those are some examples.","Great, so we've got something of an arc here that begins with introspection, reflection, discussion with others,","finding that gap between who you are, who you want to be, and experimentation.","Right, so when I talk to people months and years down the road about what they take away from this process,","it's less about the impact of a particular experiment than it is on their capacity to lead change in all the different parts of their life.","And that's really a primary goal of this approach.","Stewart Friedman, thanks very much.","Thank you.","To learn about how to put Stew's ideas into practice, you can visit his website

To begin, let me tell you one of the great rules of economics:","If you are rich, you have to be an idiot not to stay rich, and if you are poor, you have to be really smart to get rich.","This is true for individuals, but it's also true for countries.","Fancypants countries with fancypants currencies have all kinds of advantages over developing countries","including that we are able to borrow money cheaply.","In fact, because fancypants countries can borrow money so cheaply,","it actually often makes sense to run a deficit.","And the reason for this is that in the long term, our economy can grow faster than the cheap,","cheap debt we're acquiring to pay for our economy to grow.","So that is not inherently bad for nations.","The famous example for this is that in 1945 the United States had a debt that was more than one hundred percent of its GDP,","and our deficit was more than twenty percent of our GDP,","and that level of debt immediately preceded the largest expansion of our economy in history,","also the largest expansion of our waistlines in history.","Yes, that's funny, we did get fat.","So debt is not bad!","But debt that you can't repay is very bad.","The trick of fancypants countries being able to borrow money cheaply","has always been that the market assumes that fancypants countries are basically guaranteed to pay you back.","And when I said the market assumes,","I mean the market assumed until two months ago","when they realized that Greece,","a fancypants country with a fancypants currency,","maybe can't pay back its debts.","What's interesting is that Greece is probably technically in a better economic position than America was back in 1945.","But for a variety of reasons, some of the very legitimate,","the markets has cited that Greece won't be able to pay back its debt,","which in turn has led to new debt being much more expensive,","which has in turn made it completely impossible for Greece to ever pay its debt.","You see! Hank, there's a circle, and it's vicious.","That's where they got the term.","This raises the possibilities that fancypants countries","with fancypants currencies might not pay back the money we loan them,","which will probably raise interest rates for a lot of fancypants countries,","which could lead via the vicious circle to more default,","higher interest rates, more defaults, higher interest rates, I could go on like this forever,","which would be very bad, like we would yearn for the days of ten percent unemployment.","All of which is complicated by the fact that we're coming out of a worldwide recession,","and the total economic output of the world is smaller.","So there is less money coming in taxes,","but governments still need to spend approximately the same amount of money.","And for everybody who says that the problem is wasteful government spending,","we aren't even close to a balanced budget.","I mean, the United States would have to eliminate both of its two biggest expenses,","social security and defense,","in order to even come close to balancing the budget.","The only other way to shrink the deficit would to be to raise taxes,","which is not generally seen as a good idea during a recession.","So the problem of sovereign debt may be not being as cheap as it once was.","It isn't the fault of any one political ideology,","it's kind of everybody's fault.","So basically Hank, I don't want to alarm you,","but I do think we should all buy unicorn pinatas and hide our valuables in them.","Actually Hank, the unicorn strategy won't work,","because we have to keep loaning each other money,","and we have to figure out a way to loan confidently,","like we did back in 1945.","That's why the EU and the IMF are working so hard to try to nail down a bailout plan for Greece.","And if fancypants countries can't continue to convince us","that our money is as safe with them as it is inside of a unicorn pinata,","they will lose the cheap money privilege they have enjoyed for centuries.","And history tells us that once a stupid rich man gets poor,","he doesn't usually get rich again unless he is Donald Trump.","Hank, I'll see you on Monday.","Hank, I told you I'll see you on Monday.","That's your signal to stop watching, but nerdfighters,","there's still time to participate in our secret project.","Click here for more info!","Here, I've made it a heart for you.

It's gonna act as the glue for the mix.","Then, you take the chicken tenders, put them in the bag.","You seal it up really well, especially if the kids are helping.","And then, you're gonna have fun shaking up your bag","so that your chicken tenders are completely coated with the Bisquick.","Then, you're gonna take a cooking sheet that's been lined with foil and grease.","You're gonna lay out the chicken tenders.","Bake for twelve to fourteen minutes, flipping about halfway through to make sure you have a nice brown color on both sides.","These chicken tenders are right out of the oven,","look(ing) delicious, and there's no doubt your kids are gonna love them.","The next easy chicken dinner we're gonna make is perfect for having a party: Salsa chicken.","I'm gonna make a smaller batch to show you.","But you can make this really easy dish in only twenty minutes and feed a large group with absolutely no stress.","First, I've taken some chicken, cut into half inch cubes, and I sauteed it so that it was cooked all the way through.","I then poured in some Salsa.","Next, I'm gonna preheat the oven to four hundred.","And now, I'm gonna make my crust using Bisquick, eggs and water.","After that, press the crust into a greased, 9 by 12 pan.","You simply take some shredded cheddar, then you take chicken,","and simply spread it over the crust and the cheese in an even layer.","Then, I'm gonna pop it in the oven. It's gonna bake for about twenty-two to twenty-five minutes.","I added a little more cheese on top, and I popped it back in the oven for a few minutes until it fully melted.","Then, I'm gonna cut it into squares and serve. Salsa chicken.","It's a quick, easy, delicious way to feed a large group.","I'm Cricket Azima, bringing you great ideas from Bretty Crocker with Howdini.","To see more of our videos for easy recipes you can make with your kids or for your family,","visit us at bettycrocker.com/Bisquickideas."],"wordList":["Cooking","chicken","for","your","family","and","friends","has","a","ton","of","advantages","It's","reasonably","priced","healthy","low","fat","and","versatile","But","it","sure","is","easy","to","get","tired","of","the","same","old","chicken","dishes","Hi","I'm","Cricket","Azima","I","wanna","show","you","two","fast","simple","chicken","dinners","that","are","bound","to","be","family","favorites","Kids","and","chicken","fingers","a","classic","love","affair","Why","not","try","a","baked","version","Let","me","show","you","a","really","easy","way","to","make","restaurant","style","chicken","fingers","right","at","home","Start","by","preheating","the","oven","to","four","hundred","and","fifty","degrees","In","a","large","gallon","plastic","bag","start","with","some","Bisquick","then","Parmesan","cheese","salt","and","garlic","salt","and","a","touch","of","Paprika","for","flavor","Then","you're","gonna","take","an","egg","and","lightly","beat","it","Dip","the","chicken","tenders","first","in","the","egg","It's","gonna","act","as","the","glue","for","the","mix","Then","you","take","the","chicken","tenders","put","them","in","the","bag","You","seal","it","up","really","well","especially","if","the","kids","are","helping","And","then","you're","gonna","have","fun","shaking","up","your","bag","so","that","your","chicken","tenders","are","completely","coated","with","the","Bisquick","Then","you're","gonna","take","a","cooking","sheet","that's","been","lined","with","foil","and","grease","You're","gonna","lay","out","the","chicken","tenders","Bake","for","twelve","to","fourteen","minutes","flipping","about","halfway","through","to","make","sure","you","have","a","nice","brown","color","on","both","sides","These","chicken","tenders","are","right","out","of","the","oven","look","ing","delicious","and","there's","no","doubt","your","kids","are","gonna","love","them","The","next","easy","chicken","dinner","we're","gonna","make","is","perfect","for","having","a","party","Salsa","chicken","I'm","gonna","make","a","smaller","batch","to","show","you","But","you","can","make","this","really","easy","dish","in","only","twenty","minutes","and","feed","a","large","group","with","absolutely","no","stress","First","I've","taken","some","chicken","cut","into","half","inch","cubes","and","I","sauteed","it","so","that","it","was","cooked","all","the","way","through","I","then","poured","in","some","Salsa","Next","I'm","gonna","preheat","the","oven","to","four","hundred","And","now","I'm","gonna","make","my","crust","using","Bisquick","eggs","and","water","After","that","press","the","crust","into","a","greased","9","by","12","pan","You","simply","take","some","shredded","cheddar","then","you","take","chicken","and","simply","spread","it","over","the","crust","and","the","cheese","in","an","even","layer","Then","I'm","gonna","pop","it","in","the","oven","It's","gonna","bake","for","about","twenty-two","to","twenty-five","minutes","I","added","a","little","more","cheese","on","top","and","I","popped","it","back","in","the","oven","for","a","few","minutes","until","it","fully","melted","Then","I'm","gonna","cut","it","into","squares","and","serve","Salsa","chicken","It's","a","quick","easy","delicious","way","to","feed","a","large","group","I'm","Cricket","Azima","bringing","you","great","ideas","from","Bretty","Crocker","with","Howdini","To","see","more","of","our","videos","for","easy","recipes","you","can","make","with","your","kids","or","for","your","family","visit","us","at","bettycrocker","com","Bisquickideas"]},{"title":"「Jamie Oliver教你做完美的歐姆雷特」- Jamie Oliver Makes The Perfect Omelette","img":"https://www.hopenglish.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/036.jpg","link":"/jamie-oliver-makes-the-perfect-omelette?ref=search","view_count":"16457","upload_date":"2012-02-03","postId":39,"start_t":null,"end_t":null,"youtubeId":"AgHgbn_sVUw","tags":["歐姆雷特","omelette","美式蛋捲","料理","早餐","breakfast","omelete"],"sentences":["We are gonna do omelettes.","Omelettes are fantastic.","They are cheap.

That's always a great question, isn't it?","And you have to be prepared for the key questions.","Especially, \"Why are you moving on?\"","Now, if you are moving on because you can't stand your boss, right?","Which happens a lot and we've all been there.","You don't wanna say that!","What you do want to say is that I really need to be in a place","where I can be managed and developed and where I can get guidance or mentoring.","You really focus on the things that you are looking to get as opposed to all the reasons why you don't have it now.","You know there are some people who walk into that interview and they walk in a little defensively","and because they really need a job.","And they hear the words,","\"You are overqualified!\" And they are willing to take a job and do their best at it.","How do you handle, \"You are overqualified?\"","You can say things like, \"Well, I've, you know, I've really thought about that","and if I were in your shoes, I'd be asking the same question.","And when I think about it,","I can tell you for a fact,","I'm looking to downshift,","and I know this industry well, and I don't need to be in charge.","I've been the person on the totem pole before and I can do that again.","I'm really looking for a place where I can contribute but where I don't have to be the one who's running the show.\" And r","And really address those concerns which are behind the \"overqualified\" comment.","And they may say the op (opposite), \"You just don't have enough experience for us.\"","Oh, for folks who are just starting out maybe a new career","or college students who just graduated or even folks out of high school","are new to the work world that's a common problem.","So again I go back to, \"internships are great,\"","anyway that you can get some experience on your resume to demonstrate,","\"Hey, yeah, I may not be, you know, ten years in this field, but I can tell you in this...","this experience that I had this summer,","I didn't know anything going in and here is how successful I was.\" Y","You want to show situations where, yeah,","you went in without a lot of experience but were still able to succeed.","And this is where references can be so helpful as well.","Even if you don't have a lot of experience,","anybody can be a good reference for you.","Even a teacher, or a professor, or even, um, someone that you volunteered for,","who can attest your ability to learn quickly and perform well can be a great asset.","\"We already like you.

wondered: What's the big deal about blogs?","This is Blogs in Plain English.","To make sense of blogs, you have to think about the news and who makes it.","We'll look at news in the 20th vs. the 21st century to make our point.","In the 20th century, the news was produced professionally.","When news happened,","reporters wrote the stories and a tiny group of people","decided what appeared in a newspaper or broadcast.","Professional news was main stream: general and limited.","The 21st century","marked the point where news became both professional and personal.","A new kind of website called a Weblog or Blog for short","came onto the scene that let anyone be a reporter and publisher, often for free.","As blogs became popular,","they created millions of news sources","and gave everyone an audience for their own version of news.","Of course, we're using the word \"news\" loosely.","But really, isn't everything news to someone?","With a blog, a business owner can share news about his business,","a mother can share news about her family,","or a sport star can share news with fans.","These people are all \"bloggers.\"","How did this happen?","Well, blogs made sharing news on the web easy.","Anyone with an idea can start a new blog with a click of a button","and share news minutes later.","Here's how blogs work.","Blogs are websites that are organized by blog posts.","These are individual news stories,","like articles in the paper.","Bloggers simply fill out a form like this one to post a new story.","With a click of a button,","the blog post appears at the top of the web page,","just above yesterday's news.","Over time, the blog becomes a collection of these posts,","all archived for easy reference.","Also, each blog post","can become a discussion through comments left by readers.","Blogs make the news a two way street.","But really, the fuss is not about how blogs work.","It's about what people like you do with them that matters.","Let's say you have a blog about green living and outdoor photography.","It reflects your unique perspective.","This helps you build relationships with your readers","and other bloggers with similar interests.","Speaking of relationships, bloggers often work together.","In addition to comments, you'll read each other's posts,","quote each other and link your blogs together.","This creates communities of bloggers that inspire and motivate each other.","Whether it's their ease of use or the opportunities they offer,","blogs have been adopted in a very big way.","Since 2003, there have been over seventy million blogs created,","each with its own version of news.","So, the big deal about blogs is that they gave people like you the power of the media","and created a personal kind of news","that appeals to a high number of small audiences.","So, it's up to you.","What will you do with this new power?","There is likely a group of people out there who want to hear what you have to say.","You can search for blogs

night also marked the Keltic New Year and was considered the time \"between years,\" a magical time when the ghost of the dead watched the Earth.","It was the time when the veil between death and life was supposed to be at its thinnest.","On \"Samhain,\" the villagers gathered and lit huge bonfires to drive the dead back to the spirit world and keep them away from the living.","But, as the Catholic Church's influences grew in Europe, it frowned on the pagan rituals like \"Samhain.\"","In the 7th century, the Vatican began to merge it with the church-sanctioned holiday.","So November 1st was designated \"All Saints' Day\" to honor martyrs and the deceased faithful.","Both of these holidays had to do with the afterlife and about survival after death.","It was a calculated move on the part of the Church to bring more people into the fold.","\"All Saints' Day\" was known then as \"Hallowmas.\"","\"Hallow\" means \"holy\" or \"saintly\", so the translation is roughly \"Mass of the Saints.\"","The night before October 31st was \"All Hallows' Eve,\"","which gradually morphed into \"Halloween.\"","The holiday came to America with the wave of Irish immigrants during the Potato Famine of the 1840s.","They brought several of their holiday customs with them,","including \"Bobbing for Apples\" and playing tricks on neighbors, like removing gates from the front of houses.","The young pranksters were masked, so they wouldn't be recognized.","But over the years, the tradition of harmless tricks grew into outright vandalism.","Back in the 1930s, it really became a dangerous

This can be very very common.","If you walk into her room that she is on her own.","You come sit by her and whatever. She notices that it's you.","She might do something called \"preening,\" or she might fluff up her hair,","she might adjust her clothing, she might redo her makeup.","And this can be a very definite sign that she likes you,","because she is trying to look good for you, make sure that she is looking pretty enough for you or whatever.","Second sign is when...when you talk to her (this is a pretty obvious sign...)","When you talk to her,","she might blush, she might stutter,","or you know, nervous, stuffs like that.","She gets all frigidy. You know, just simple things like that.","The third sign is if she holds your gaze longer than an average person a lot or shorter.","So if you look at her and she looks away quickly,","not turns her whole head, but you know what I mean.","If she moves away from your eye contact very quickly,","this could definitely show that she likes you, or if she tries to hold it longer than most people.","The fourth thing is if she kind of plays like a damsel in distress.","Like if you are with her,","for example, you may be outside and it's very cold out,","and she will give subtle hints that she is cold and that she wants a jacket.","Well, this is kind of her saying that \"Lend me your jacket,\" you know, something like that.","The fifth sign is very common,","but it may not be an exact way to tell if a girl likes you or not,","because some people are just a bit more touchy-feely people.","But usually when a girl likes you,","she is going to touch your arm a lot when she talks to you;","she is going to brush against you, do anything to kind of,","you know, touch you, and let you know that she's there.","The sixth thing is that she might show up (at) places where you are going.","It's not a coincidence.","It's really not. Let's say,","she...you and her were talking one day at school.","And you mentioned that you were going to stop by a restaurant on Thursday, four o'clock, for dinner,","something like that.","Well, she's probably going to get one of her friends,","and go there at the same exact time that you are.","And that is a very, very, very obvious thing.","The seventh thing is","if you notice when she's around her friends and you are around with them,","if her friends giggle at you a lot and make fun of her like,","\"Oh, blah blah blah...\" \"Look at him!\" You know, something like that.","This is a sure sign that she likes you.","The eighth sign is pretty obvious again.","If she asks you a lot about a girlfriend,","or what's your preference in girls,","or you know, she might do something like pull off a picture of a girl and be like,","\"Oh, isn't she super pretty?\"","and she might try to wait for your response and see if you say,","\"Oh, you are prettier,\" something like that.","Another sign and this is a fool-proof sign,","but it's when... Let's say,","if you have friends over, she gets in,","she flirts with your friends in front of you,","or she talks about the boyfriend that she doesn't have.","You know, stuffs that kind of spark jealousy,","to see if you were responding in jealousy manners.","So then she can tell whether, you know, you like her or not.","You know, it might be anything from talking about how hot a movie star is,","to flirting with your best friends.","So it really depends.","And then another thing to look for and this is fool-proof either.","But if she posts up like a picture of a really pretty friend that she has or that you have,","a mutual friend or something,","and she talks about how pretty she is.","Well, that's her kind of saying like,","\"Oh, are you going to comment me then,\"","and say, you know, \"Am I that pretty?\" or, you know,","she's hoping that you'll say,","\"Oh, I thought you are way prettier,\" or something like that.","Alright, well, I hope that these signs help you guys figure out whether she likes you or not.","And if (you) have any more questions, common below or send me messages. Okay, bye-bye!","Oh, and I just wanna say that, these are not scientific. They are not.","I have done some researches,","and I...I'm not a psychologist,","I wanna major in psychology,","but I'm not at any point near.","And these are just from personal experience,","from my research done, and from, like my friends talking,","stuffs like just observing being a girl.","So, alright, you have a good night.

Add here accessories if you want to.","Here it is all done.","If you have straight hair, this will look really nice.","And if you have curly hair, you might have to straighten your hair first,","because I've never tried this on curly hair before.","This is another cute hairstyle that is extremely easy to do.","First, I'm going to create a little pompadour above my head","by just grabbing some hair and adding as much as I want to it.","So I'm just going to grab some more from each side.","Then I'm going to push my hair forward to create a little bump,","and with bobby pins, I'm going to pin that part down.","I'd like to use two bobby pins and cross them together to keep the bump in place.","Now I'm going to gather my hair all to one side,","and braid this section into a regular three-strand braid.","You can even do a fishtail braid,","but if you are really pressed for time, then a regular three-strand braid will suffice.","Now I'm going to use my small elastic band and tie the ends off.","Then I'm just going to stretch out the braid to make it look fuller and bigger.","So I'm just going to tug on each strand.","If you have a layer hair like I do, all you have to do is just pin the strands back so that everything will look neat.","I'm also going to use a flower pin to just pin my front layer away.","And that's the completed look.","I used to wear my hair like this all the time, especially when the pompadour was really in.","But I haven't done it for a while so it was nice to do it again.","And lastly we have the Messy High Bun.","If you prefer low buns, just tie your hair lower.","But for me, I'm going to do a higher bun.","So I'm going to just make the really high ponytail,","and since I like it on the side, I'm going to position the ponytail on the side.","To add more buns into my hair, I'm going to back comb the ponytail with just a regular comb.","And you don't need any hairspray, because this is gonna go into a bun later.","When that's done, just grab the ponytail, and twist it around into a circle.","Then just wrap them around each other.","Then grab a tiny little elastic band and just put that overall back here.","And this will give you a really messy look.","If you don't want your bun too big, just connect it down with some bobby pins.","Add a flower, clip to complete the look and we're done.","So here's the front and the back of the bun.","It's really messy.","This is also the hairstyle I sported in that milkshake video and some people are asking about it.","I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial and I will talk to you in my

I've decided to put together a video that","instead of just showing you how to spin a pencil, I'll actually teach you how to spin a pencil.","So let's get started with the basics. We're gonna start with just going Once Around.","As you can see, I'm only using three fingers, the index finger, the middle finger and the thumb.","And the pencil is off-center and that most of the weight is off to the left side of the screen here.","What I am gonna do is I'm gonna push the pencil around my thumb,","and then catch it between my index finger and thumb.","And you'll see that the weight shift goes from the left side to the middle when I catch it.","And then when I do it again, I have to kind of shift the weight back to the left.","Not only is this technique essential for the more advanced stuff I'm about to show you,","but you can also use it to spin anything that's even, similarly shaped to a pen or pencil that's lying around your house,","such as a screwdriver or even something as crazy as a banana.","Note that I'm using the same basic techniques here.

Vsause. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about yawning.","Why do we yawn? And why is yawning contagious? How come when I see someone yawn or even think about it makes me kind of want to yawn?","First things first: definitions. When you yawn, you inhale air and stretch your eardrums. That's why your ears pop when you yawn.","Now, if you yawn and at the same time stretch your whole body, that is called pandiculation.","A common misconception about yawning is that people yawn when they need more air, more oxygen,","but studies have shown that no matter how much oxygen is in the air around the person, they won't yawn more or less frequently.","And when people exercise and their bodies do in fact need more oxygen, they don't yawn more often.","Instead, research has shown that our first answer most likely lies in being cool.","When you are exhausted, tired, deep brain temperatures increase. But your brain is like a computer. It operates best at a very specific temperature.","And so, yawning, bringing all this outside air in through your ears and your mouth cools your facial blood and actually helps cool down your brain.","This phenomenon is particularly easy to observe when parakeets yawn.","Researchers have found that parakeets only yawn within a very specific range of temperatures.","Too cold outside, an yawning would cool the brain too much; too hot, an yawning would actually warm it up.","Parakeets are perfect test subjects for this effect, because they yawn just like you and me except they don't exhibit contagious yawning.","If you show a person a video of other people yawing, it's likely that the person watching will yawn his or her self,","unless you put an ice pack on their forehead keeping their brain cooler.","Seriously, the University of Albany has found that people contagiously yawn less frequently when they have ice packs on their head,","which means that yawning to cool your brain isn't just for the birds.","Studies have shown that yawning also increases blood pressure, stretches facial muscles, and increases focus.","When you pandiculate, you stretch all of your muscles, making them better ready to be used at any moment.","So when it comes to a herd of prey animals, contagious yawning makes sense, because a herd that yawns together stays alert together.","Under this theory, yawning is advantageously contagious,","because that first animal to yawn acts as a sort of reminder to the rest of the herd to keep themselves ready and alert.","But of course, when we say that yawning is contagious, we don't mean like a disease. Instead, it's a bit more closely related to empathy.","Sympathy is when you are concerned for others, where you wish someone is better off.","Empathy is the ability to recognize and share the emotions that other people feel.","Emotional contagion is when the emotions of people around you influence the way you feel without you even having to separate yourselves from them,","like when being around happy people lifts your spirit, or how anger and fear can lead to mob mentality.","Now, children with autism who exhibit impaired social interaction and communication","yawn less frequently than other children when viewing videos of people yawning.","So is yawning an emotional contagion, or is it about empathy?","Last year, the University of Pisa found that yawn contagiousness is greatest with family, and then friends, and then acquaintances and lastly, strangers.","And a study at Leeds University brought in participants to take a test that measure how empathetic they were.","But before the test began, amongst them was one person who worked for the researchers, and this person yawned every minute for ten minutes.","Interestingly, the people who wound up scoring the highest on the empathy test were also the ones who contagiously yawn the most.","Let's talk more about animal yawning.","What fascinates me so much is that animals across many species all yawn, but they do so for different reasons.","Animals like guinea pigs and some monkeys yawn to intimidate and show their sharp, scary teeth. Some penguins yawn to attract mates.","And when snakes yawn, it seems to be about realigning their jaws and opening their tracheas to breathe better after a big body-disfiguring meal.","Fish yawn more frequently when water oxygen levels are low, or water heat levels are high.","So when you yawn, you're participating in the behavior shared across all kinds of animals,","but most likely you're yawning for purposes unique to your species, us humans.","And what's really cool is that yawning is most likely an ancient signal telling the rest of us humans: \"Let's do this! Let's survive!\"","And as always, thanks for
